#
# Implement strStr().
# 
# Return the index of the first occurrence of needle in haystack, or -1 if
# needle is not part of haystack.
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: haystack = "hello", needle = "ll"
# Output: 2
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: haystack = "aaaaa", needle = "bba"
# Output: -1
# 
# 
# Clarification:
# 
# What should we return when needle is an empty string? This is a great
# question to ask during an interview.
# 
# For the purpose of this problem, we will return 0 when needle is an empty
# string. This is consistent to C's strstr() and Java's indexOf().

class Solution:
    def strStr(self, haystack: str, needle: str) -> int:
        if len(needle) == 0 :
            return 0
        else :
            return haystack.find(needle)
